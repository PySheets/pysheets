## Example: Basic Accounting ‚äû

![PySheets](src/static/icons/screenshot-accounting.png)

This example shows how to do basic accounting:
 - We convert sheet data into a Pandas DataFrame
 - We rename columns and add a new one
 - We calculate the revenue per year per product
 - We join all products into one DataFrame

This exercise shows how hard it is to manipulate rows in Pandas.
The reason is that Pandas dataframes were designed to focus on columns.
For use-cases such as this one, it would be better to handly multi-dimensional
data using pandas-pivot or by transposing the original dataframes.
